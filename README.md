A Cardgame
In this project, you are asked to program a card game in which two players place cards in chains, trade the
cards and sell the chains. The cards have 8 different faces corresponding to semi-precious and precious
gemstones. The goal of the game is to chain-up the cards of equal gemstones to gain coins. The player
with the most coins at the end wins. The chains for the gemstone cards are formed by each player for all
to see and there are a maximum two chains per player (or three chains if the player purchases a third).
Each chain can only be formed with a single type of gemstone. The game proceeds with the players
taking turns. Each player starts with five cards in their hand and the remaining cards form a draw deck.
The cards in a playerâ€™s hand need to be kept sorted. Cards will be placed on a discard pile during the
game
